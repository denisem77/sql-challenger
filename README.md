Im a newly hired data engineer with Pewlett Hackard! Don't worry, its fictional! 
My task as a newly hired employee is to complete a research prject about previously employeed people during the 1980s and 1990s.
I will use the 6 CSV files in order to complete this. 
I will:
-Design a table to hold the data from the CSV files
- Import the CSV files into a SQL database
- Answer questions about the data

All of those actions will showcase my ability to perform:
-Data modeling
-Data engineering
-Data analysis

Please enjoy...
